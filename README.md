 Logistical regression analysis to quantify the impact of poverty and physical activity on depression

We have probably heard the ongoing debate of whether money can make people happy. For our part, money might not make someone happy yet a significant portion of the things that make people happy requires money. Therefore, the lack of wealth might be at the origin of depression of an individual as they do not have the means necessary to do what makes them happy. Do people who are living in poverty experience depression more than those who are not? To get an idea of this relationship, it would be good to answer the question of how does poverty affect depression?

Additionally, according to the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 9.2% of Americans aged ≥12 years experienced a past-year major depressive episode. Particularly, the Covid-19 has impacted people’s mental health because of the social distancing rules, and the pandemic made it harder to workout. Thus, understanding some other unconventional factors that might have an effect on depression becomes crucial to act upon in at an individual and a collective level. Thus, we were wondering if there is relationship between exercising and depression? In fact, it would be interesting to explore if there is a relationship between physical activity and depression. Certainly, a person’s ability to exercise might depend on their financial situation. Those who are higher compared to the poverty guidelines can afford some time to workout while some who are not in such a privileged situation might need to work more and harder, and in doing so have less time to workout. From this observation, one can wonder whether being physically active has an impact on the relationship between wealth depression.

Our primary objective is to explore the variables related to depression by specifically looking at an individual’s physical activity levels and the socioeconomic conditions of participants. The former will help our team identify if physical activity promotes a healthier mind, while the latter variable will help identify a trend on if and how financial situations impact one’s mental health. In sum, our final goal is to better understand the relationship between these factors so as to identify potential risk factors or protective factors that could help indicate mental health outcomes.
